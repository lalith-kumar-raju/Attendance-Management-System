    ```

## ▶️ How to Run the Application

1.  **Make sure you have the following files in the same directory:**
    - `app.py` (the main script)
    - `Amrita.png` (for the background image, or you can change the path in the script)

2.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## 📝 How to Use

1.  **Add a Student**:
    - Enter the Student ID, Name, and Parent's Email in the respective fields.
    - Click "Add Student". The student will be added to the list and saved to `attendance.xlsx`.

2.  **Mark Attendance**:
    - Select a date using the "Select Date" button.
    - Select a student from the list.
    - Click "Mark Present" or "Mark Absent".
    - The attendance for that student on the selected date will be recorded in the Excel file.
    - The selection will automatically move to the next student in the list to allow for quick marking.

    - Click "Send Email to parent". An email will be sent to the registered parent's email address if their child was marked absent.
    - **Note**: You need to configure your email credentials in `app.py` for this to work. Find the following lines and replace them with your details:
      ```python
      sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
